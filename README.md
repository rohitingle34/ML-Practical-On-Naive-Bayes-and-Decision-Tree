# ML-Practical-On-Naive-Bayes-and-Decision-Tree
## 1) Use “naïve_bayes_classification” dataset. Build a naïve bayes classification model to predict whether a person is diabetic based on glucose and bloodpressure attribute values.
## 2) Use iris dataset and create a classification model using Gaussian naïve bayes classifier. Compare the result of Naïve bayes Classifier with the Decision tree classifier
## 3) Use breast cancer dataset and apply Gaussian naïve bayes to create a classification model for predicting whether a person suffers from cancer or not. Check the accuracy of your model
## 4) Use titanic dataset. Use the attributes: Class of the room, Sex, Age, number of siblings/spouses, number of parents/children, passenger fare and port of embarkation information. Compare the result of Naïve bayes Classifier with the Decision tree classifier.
## 5) 5) Use the given dataset, which consists of weather, temp and play as attributes. Perform the following task:¶
### i. Apply data pre-processing and convert categorical values into numeric values.
### ii. Use the list “weather”, “temp” as features and “play” as target. Try to create a model using Naïve bayes classifier to predict whether a person plays the game depending upon the values of weather and temperature.
## 6) Consider the following problem: In AB Company, there is a salary distribution table based on Year of Experience as given in “salary_dataset.csv”. “The scenario is you are a HR officer; you got a candidate with 5 years of experience. Then what is the best salary you should offer to him?”
